The Melbourne Event Hire Website is an online platform where users can hire items for any type of event. The website was created to help make it easy for people to find and rent event-related items, such as decorations, furniture, and more.

# Technology Used
The following technologies were used to create the Melbourne Event Hire Website:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- Jinja
- Python
- PostgresSQL

The Melbourne Event Hire Website is currently deployed online at [Melbourne Event Hire Website](https://flask-app-iyi5.onrender.com/home).


# Troubleshooting
Its far from finished.
Currently, the website is still a bit buggy, and there have been difficulties getting all of the tabs to work correctly. Specifically, the Gallery and Shopping Cart tabs do not work, while the other tabs seem to work fine.

# Features to be Added
There are several features that we plan to add to the Melbourne Event Hire Website in the future. Some of these include:

The ability for users to select a quantity of items to be removed from their shopping cart
An automatic email notification system for when a user submits an enquiry
Additional CSS improvements to make the site more visually appealing
A sign-up and login page that matches the look and feel of the contact form.
Actuall images from the wedding to advertise items for hire.
